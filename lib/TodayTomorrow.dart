This file provides no functionality. It is solely for tracking what I have done today and what I want to do tomorrow.
Today 4/7/2019: I created the Join a Line superficial functionality and am able to add new people to a line that already exists.
                I am able to add and delete people from a line.
                I can query firestore and retrieve the current number of people in a line. (Add a realtime updating stream to this so its always current)
                I can create a new line for a new store but this functionality is meant to be inside the Account Home Page (Make Account Home Page)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Tomorrow:       Make 'account home page'
                Add functionality to home page to create a new line
                Make 'Waiting Screen'
                Create data stream for number of people in line and display position on 'Waiting Screen'

                Create a system where a store can create a new line with a unique 6 character identifier that can be used to reference the store for adding new
                people to the line for that store.
